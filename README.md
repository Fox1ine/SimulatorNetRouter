#Net Router Simulator
SimpleNet Router Simulator: A Basic Network Routing Simulator

The Simple Net Router Simulator is an easy-to-understand Python project designed for simulating basic network routing operations. It offers a straightforward and user-friendly approach to modeling how data packets are moved across a simulated network of servers and routers.

Key Features: Server Simulation: Mimic server instances that can send and receive data packets.

Router Logic: Basic routing functionalities to forward data packets to the correct server.

Data Packet Management: Create and manage data packets within the network.

Connection Management: Handle the connections and disconnections between servers and routers.

User Interface: Simple command-line interface for interaction with the network simulator.
